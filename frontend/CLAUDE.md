# frontend

Read the root `CLAUDE.md` first. This file covers what is specific to `frontend/`.

## Stack

TanStack Start on React 19 with file-based routes (`src/routes/`), SSR via Nitro's node server,
Tailwind v4, oxlint (type-aware) and oxfmt, vitest with Testing Library. Node and pnpm versions come
from the root `mise.toml`; never install with npm or yarn (the `preinstall` hook refuses).

## Commands (repo root)

`make fe-check` before every push (typecheck, lint, format check, tests). `make fe-fix` applies
lint and format fixes. `make fe-dev` for the dev server on :3002. Inside `frontend/`, the same as
`pnpm typecheck|lint|fmt|test|dev|build`.

## Conventions

- Routes are files; `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated and ignored. Run `pnpm generate-routes`
  after adding a route (typecheck and lint depend on it; `make fe-check` does it).
- Import app code through the `#/` alias, never relative paths across directories.
- Components live in `src/components/` as `kebab-case.tsx` with a colocated `*.test.tsx`.
- Types and the client come from the OpenAPI contract once generated; never hand-write request
  or response shapes. Business rules (which events are allowed, field errors) arrive from the API.
- No `any`; the lint config is strict on promises, hooks and imports. Fix the code, not the rule.
- `vitest.config.ts` is deliberately separate from `vite.config.ts`; keep test settings there.
- Styling is Tailwind utility classes; no CSS modules, no styled-components.
